/**
 * Static "BETA" badge shown next to the title.
 *
 * We deliberately do NOT show a version number here. This is the WebUI client;
 * it cannot reliably know which EvoScientist backend version the user actually
 * has installed, so showing the latest PyPI release would falsely imply they're
 * running it. "BETA" honestly signals an early-stage product without making a
 * version claim — and needs no network request.
