// "Teams" are curated user-summonable subagents. The backend exposes them at

// per-thread. Mirrors the shape of `modelCommand.ts` — same reason: the type +
// storage key belong next to the feature, not buried in a hook.

/** Thread-metadata key carrying the per-thread summoned team names.
 *
 *  Persisting to thread metadata (rather than localStorage) is the same
 *  choice we made for `model_override`: the selection follows the
 *  conversation, not the browser tab. Backend stays stateless w.r.t. this
 *  key — it only reads `configurable.active_teams` on the run config, which
 *  `useChat.buildRunConfig` will populate from local state that is itself
 *  seeded from this metadata key on thread switch. */
